# @kayahr/ts-json-schema-generator

[GitHub] | [NPM]

A drop-in replacement for [ts-json-schema-generator], bundling the tool and all its dependencies into a single module.

This package is primarily for my own use as a single dev dependency across my projects, to centralize the review of updates for the dependencies that ts-json-schema-generator brings along, and to reduce the threat of a supply-chain attack. Use at your own risk.

Usage
-----

Install as development dependency:

```
npm install -DE @kayahr/ts-json-schema-generator
```

Usage is the same as with the original [ts-json-schema-generator], so check upstream documentation for more info.
